# wtf is this

This is a plugin to prevent proxies vpns and other means to hide an ip to access your minecraft server.

For this is it uses the api from ipwhois I kinda cheated bec i didn't want to pay like $99 per month so yes look at the code.

It basically uses an endpoint ony for browsers and pretends to be a browser to get the info.
